## Don't shy away from simple pencil and paper. If you head straight to the computer your more likely to get bogged down in the *how* without thinking about the *what* and the *why*.

Use pencils and cheap paper so that you feel free to erase or just throw paper away. No need for fancy Moleskine notebooks.

## When it's time to work on the computer, use Sketch, Figma, or PhotoShop.

Sketch is the industry standard. Web design is its main purpose. You're gonna love it.

Figma is the best option if you're on a budge. It has a great free-tier offering. It doesn't have the industry cred of Sketch or PhotoShop, so don't bank on landing a job just because you know Figma.

PhotoShop is used for a *lot* of things besides just making websites, so it's a pretty confusing tool to start out with. That said, there are a ton of learning resources out there, and being skilled at PhotoShop is a highly desirable skill.
