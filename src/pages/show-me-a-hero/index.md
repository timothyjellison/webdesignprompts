## A hero delivers key information about the product while setting the crucial markers of brand identity. It sets the tone for the whole experience of using the website. It's a truly heroic responsibility.

Let's look at a few techniques for creating eye-catching heroes that get the job done.

### White Text Over a Bold Color

Check out digital creative agency Playground Inc., and be sure to refresh their page a few times. You'll notice their hero is a full height &amp; width solid block of color with white text over it. It's attractive, elegant, confident, and professional.

They're are a few big advantages to this technique. If you have a single color that pops, you can just rely on white, black, and shades of grey for all your other text and background colors.

This approach puts a ton of pressure on the text, so choose interesting fonts and give them plenty of whitespace. If you're going to have lots of hierarchical text elements (title, and below that a subtitle, and below that a small paragraph) you'll need to make them different sizes to help users see which text is more important and where their eye should be travelling.

*Prompt:* Find some colors that look great with white text over them. Make a list of your favorites and keep that list handy for when you need to a build a site for a person or product that doesn't have a strong brand identify.
